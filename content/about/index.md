Hello! I'm Mayuresh, a software engineer based in Boston, MA who enjoys building software. I have over 3 years of experience in the software domain.

After acquiring a Bachelore's degree in Computer Engineering from [K J Somaiya College of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/kjsce/), I worked at [Harman International Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.harman.com/) for 2 years where I demonstrated my Software development skills in the Infotainment domain.

In order to expand the horizons of my knowledge, I decided to pursue Masters Degree in Computer Science from [Northeastern University](https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/). While pursing the Masters degree, I was fortunate enough to get an Internship opportunity from [IDEXX Laboratories](https://www.idexx.com/en/) in their R&D Software Department where I worked on the Software System in the blood analyzer Medical Instrument.  Shortly after graduating, I joined [Amazon Robotics](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/) as an System and Software Support Engineer.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
